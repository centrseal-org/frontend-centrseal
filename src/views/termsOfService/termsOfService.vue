              <p>
                CentrSeal provides a platform for realtors and property managers
                ("Realtors") to verify tenant information through paystubs and
                bank account connections. Tenants use the app to securely upload
                their financial documents or connect their bank accounts for
                verification purposes. CentrSeal does not provide legal or
                financial advice and is not responsible for the outcome of any
                tenant verification or rental decision.
